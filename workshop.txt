wrapper classes= like for int integer
                          short short 
                          long long
 to make java 100% object orianted we use  wrapper classes

==> object ---- number ----boolean------character
 number ------byte----short-integer---long--float---double

==> object class: it is the supermost class in java.
              every class that we defined will extend this class by default


==>java.lang== contains all other packages so defaulted we include it

pascal casing: every word started with upper case  ex: StudentsAre Inside A class
camelcasing: word should be in lower case ex:studentsAre Inside A Class
